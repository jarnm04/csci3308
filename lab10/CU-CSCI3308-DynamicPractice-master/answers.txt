Part 1

2) After running the program, it shows that a seg fault occured
4) The program crashes on line 89
6) Add the following code:

	coordinate_t* zero_pt = NULL;
	pt = malloc(sizeof(pt));

   to the beginning of the for loop that starts at line 87
9) break zeroDist
11) print other_pt->x
    print other_pt->y
12) I used 'clear' to remove the breakpoint and I used 'c' to continue


Part 2

2) The program is definitely losing 23,999,984 bytes and possibly
   loses 16 bytes out of a total 24,000,000 bytes
3) The problemed lines are: 41, 89, 93
4) The problem is that space is being allocated, but then not being
   freed after it is done being used. In order to fix this, just free
   the space that has been allocated after the pointer is done being
   used. I used the 'free()' function at lines 51 and 96.
